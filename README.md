# MemeMaker

Makes memes from tweets scraped from twitter. Use memeMaker.py to run, to change the input file modify line 5.

My input files were generated using taspinar's twitterscraper, any input files should be formatted similarly. 

This is a very early prototype, expect to find bugs, abherrent behavior, half finished features, and inexplicable design decisions.
